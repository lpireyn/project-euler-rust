# Project Euler in Rust :crab:

These are my solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, written in Rust :crab:.

The purpose of this project is to learn Rust.
In this spirit, I try to limit my use of external crates and keep this project as simple as possible.

## Usage

The solutions are implemented as functions with corresponding unit tests.

You can run all tests with:

``` shell
cargo --quiet test
```

You can run specific tests with:

``` shell
cargo --quiet test solution42
```

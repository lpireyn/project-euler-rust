# Project Euler in Rust :crab:

These are my solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, written in Rust :crab:.

The purpose of this project is to learn Rust.
In this spirit, I try to limit my use of external crates and keep this project as simple as possible.

## Usage

``` shell
cargo --quiet run -- NUMBER
```

where `NUMBER` is the problem number.
